    <h2 id="description" class="section-title">Fake Controllers - The Future of Non-Existent Gaming</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>
            Are you tired of using real controllers that actually work? Well, say no more! We bring you the "Fake Controller", 
            the most advanced non-existent gaming controller on the market. This controller is so revolutionary, it doesn't even exist. 
            Experience the feeling of holding nothing in your hands as you play your favorite games with absolutely no functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Fake Controller is perfect for gamers who want to take a break from reality and dive into a world where nothing works, 
            because there’s literally nothing there! With a sleek, invisible design and no buttons to press, you’ll enjoy endless hours of 
            doing nothing, which is exactly what this controller was designed for.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, due to its overwhelming popularity and complete non-existence, the Fake Controller is sold out indefinitely.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="how-it-works" class="section-title">How It Works</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>
            The Fake Controller works by not working at all! When you pick it up (or imagine picking it up), you’ll feel a wave of 
            nothingness, which enhances your gaming experience by removing the need to actually play. Simply think about your favorite 
            games, and the Fake Controller will do absolutely nothing. The lack of buttons, joysticks, or functionality ensures you’ll 
            never experience frustration – because there’s nothing to frustrate you!
        </p>
        <p>
            The magic of the Fake Controller is in its sheer simplicity. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the fact that you don’t need 
            to do anything at all. Gaming has never been easier... or more non-existent.
        </p>

    <div class="section-content">
        <p>
            Otters are playful, intelligent creatures that inhabit both marine and freshwater environments. Known for their agility in water, 
            they use tools such as rocks to open shellfish, making them one of the few non-human animals to use tools. Their social behavior 
            is also fascinating—they often hold hands while sleeping to stay together in groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Otters are a reminder of the importance of nature and preserving habitats for future generations. Much like EKAF Controllers, 
            otters are a symbol of creative thinking and adaptability in their environment.
